# Tell Net I said Hi!
### Greetings and welcome @Challengers!

###### This challenge will not be as easy as the last may have been.  
In this challenge will will be addressing 2 very helpful and powerful aspects of programming that are often overlooked and underused.
**Finite State Machines** and **Regular Expressions**!  

Both of these concepts may seem fairly complex, but in actuality it all depends on the implementations.
For this challenge, we will be combining these 2 concepts.  

**Your task?** Implement a regex search in the language of your choice using a FSM. Your program should create the appropriate states based on the regex provided and then use that state machine to determine if the input string has any matches.
Your machine can have any level of efficiency and support any level of regex special characters.  
The points are as follows:

- [ ] 3000 - Can compile a regex with no special characters and run it against as string. First match only.
- [ ] 1000 - Can compile regex containing the | character appropriately.
- [ ] 1000 - Can compile regex containing the + character.
- [ ] 1000 - Can compile regex containing the * character.
- [ ] 1000 - Can compile regex containing the ( and ) characters. 
- [ ] 1000 - Can compile regex containing the [ and ] characters.
- [ ] 1000 - Can compile regex containing escape sequences.
- [ ] 1000 - Can compile regex containing ? or .


**This challenge is worth a total of 10000 CST.**  
You can look up more info on FSM and regex on Wikipedia.
If yoy have any additional questions about what qualifies a program, ask them here. Tag me if you must.

***GOOD LUCK***  
***HAPPY CODING***
